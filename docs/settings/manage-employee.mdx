### 📨 Invite Employee (Recommended)

Admins can invite employees via email.

#### **Flow**

1. Admin enters employee details  
2. System sends an invitation email  
3. Employee accepts the invite  
4. Employee sets their own password  
5. Employee is added to the team  

#### **Fields**

- **Employee Name** *(required)*
- **Employee Email ID** *(required)*
- **Employee Work Mode** *(Office / Remote / Hybrid)*
- **Page Access Control Role** *(required)*
- **Teams** *(required)*

---

### 👤 Add Manual Employee

Admins can directly create employee accounts without sending an invite.

> Recommended for company-owned systems or stealth monitoring setups.

#### **Fields**

- **Employee Name** *(required)*
- **Employee Email ID** *(required)*
- **Employee Work Mode** *(required)*
- **Page Access Control Role** *(required)*
- **Teams** *(required)*
- **Password** *(required)*

#### **Security Note**

> Make sure to securely share the password with the employee.  
> Do not expose credentials in public channels.  
> Admins may log in first and hand over the system if required.

## 🔐 Page Access Control Roles

Roles define which pages and features an employee can access.

Typical roles:

- **Admin** – Full system access  
- **Manager** – Limited admin access  
- **Team Lead** – Limited admin access  
- **No Access** – Disabled or restricted account  

> Custom roles can be created using **[Create Page Access Role](/docs/access-control/access-control)**.

---

## 👥 Teams Management

Employees can be assigned to one or multiple teams.

- Create teams using **Create New Team**
- Assign employees for structured monitoring and reporting
- Teams help in filtering analytics and tracking productivity

---

## ✏️ Edit Employee

Admins can update:

- Name  
- Email  
- Role  
- Work Mode  
- Teams  
- Access permissions  

---

## ❌ Delete Employee

Deleting an employee will:

- Revoke system access

> Historical logs remain preserved for audit and compliance.

---

## 🖥 OS Detection

Trackpilots automatically detects the employee system OS:

- 🪟 Windows  
- 🐧 Linux  
- 🍎 macOS  

This helps in debugging agent issues and deployment tracking.

---

## 📦 Agent Version Tracking

The **Version** column shows the installed Trackpilots desktop agent version.

Use this to:

- Ensure latest agent rollout  
- Identify outdated clients  
- Debug compatibility issues  

---

## 🕒 Last Login Tracking

Displays the last time the employee logged in.

Useful for:

- Always assign **roles and teams**  
- Regularly review inactive employees  
- Enforce strong passwords  

---

## 🧩 API & Developer Notes
