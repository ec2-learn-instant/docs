The **Stealth Monitoring** settings page allows administrators to enable hidden background monitoring for employees. When enabled, work tracking starts automatically when the system boots and stops when the system shuts down, without exposing the Trackpilots app to the user.

## 📌 Overview

Stealth Monitoring is designed for **company-owned devices and controlled environments** where monitoring must run silently in the background.

### When enabled:

- Work tracking starts automatically on system startup  
- Tracking stops automatically on system shutdown  
- The Trackpilots desktop app is hidden from the user  
- Users cannot view or control the monitoring agent  

> Once your new settings are saved, they will be applied and reflected on your dashboard and employee systems within **1 hour**.
