🔐 **Secure Your API Access**

API keys are used to authenticate and authorize requests to the Trackpilots REST APIs.
</Callout>

## 📌 Overview

Trackpilots uses **API Keys** to securely authenticate API requests.  
Each API key is unique and must be kept confidential.

You can generate and manage API keys from the **Developer Tools** section in the Trackpilots dashboard.

Follow these steps to generate a new API key:

1. Go to **Developer Tools** menu in your Trackpilots dashboard.
2. Select **API Keys** from the menu.  
   👉 Direct link: [https://app.trackpilots.com/developer-tools/api-keys](https://app.trackpilots.com/developer-tools/api-keys)
3. Click the **Create API Key** button in the **top-right corner**.
4. Enter a **Name** for your API key.
5. Click **Create**.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

<Callout type="warning">
🔒 **Store Your API Key Securely**

The API key is displayed **only once** during creation.  
Make sure to copy and store it in a secure location.
</Callout>

- ❌ You **cannot view the full API key again** after creation.
- 🔄 If lost or compromised, **generate a new API key**.
- 🚫 Never share API keys publicly or commit them to Git repositories.

---

## 🔑 Using the API Key

Use the API key as a **Bearer token** in the Authorization header for all Trackpilots API requests.

### Example Request Header

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
