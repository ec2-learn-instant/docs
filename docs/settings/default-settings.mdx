## 🧩 Developer Notes

- Default settings are stored at the **Organization Configuration Service**  
- Employee-specific settings override organisation defaults  
- APIs should validate:
  - Work hours ≤ 24 hours  
  - Productive hours ≤ work hours  
  - Screenshot interval ≥ 1 minute  
  - Valid timezone format  
- Changes are propagated via configuration sync pipelines  

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Define defaults before onboarding employees

- Set realistic productive hour targets  
- Align timezone with company HQ or payroll systems  
- Document default monitoring policies internally
