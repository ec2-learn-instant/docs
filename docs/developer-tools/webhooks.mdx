🔔 **Real-time Event Notifications**

Webhooks allow Trackpilots to send real-time event data to your application whenever an event occurs.
</Callout>

## Overview

Webhooks enable your system to automatically receive event notifications from Trackpilots.  
When a selected event occurs, Trackpilots sends a **POST request** to your configured webhook URL with the event payload.

You can create and manage webhooks from the **Developer Tools** section in the Trackpilots dashboard.

## Create a Webhook

Follow the steps below to create a new webhook:

1. Go to **Developer Tools** in your Trackpilots dashboard.
2. Select **Webhooks** from the menu.  
   👉 Direct link:  
   `https://app.trackpilots.com/developer-tools/webhooks`
3. Click the **Create Webhook** button located at the **top-right corner**.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **Webhook Name** – A friendly name to identify the webhook.
   - **Webhook URL** – The endpoint where event notifications will be sent.  
     Example:
     ```text

## Event Selection

You can choose specific events or enable all events at once.

### Select All Events

- Receive notifications for **all supported events**.

### Desktop Events

The following desktop-related events are currently supported:

- `desktop.screenshot_tracking.captured`
- `desktop.app_tracking.captured`
- `desktop.activity_tracking.captured`

Each selected event will trigger a webhook notification when it occurs.

---

## Webhook Behavior

- Trackpilots sends a **POST request** to the configured webhook URL.
- The request contains event details in **JSON format**.
- Your endpoint should respond with a **2xx HTTP status code** to acknowledge successful delivery.

## Best Practices

<Callout type="warning">
⚠️ **Ensure High Availability**

Make sure your webhook endpoint is publicly accessible and highly available to avoid missed events.
</Callout>

- Validate incoming webhook payloads.
- Log webhook requests for debugging and auditing.
- Handle duplicate events gracefully.
- Secure your endpoint using signature validation (recommended).
