---

## 🔐 Permissions & Access Control

Only users with appropriate roles can update expected work hours:

- **Admin**
- **Custom Role with Work Hours Permission**

Permissions are managed via **[Page Access Control Roles](/docs/access-control/access-control)**.

---

## 🧩 Developer Notes

- Expected hours are stored per user in the **User Configuration Service**  
- Values are synced to analytics pipelines hourly  
- APIs should validate:
  - Work hours ≤ 24 hours  
  - Productive hours ≤ Work hours  
  - In-time in valid time format (HH:mm)  
- Defaults are applied when no custom configuration exists  

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Set standard work hours for all full-time employees  
- Define realistic productive hour expectations  
- Align in-time with company attendance policies  
- Regularly review part-time and contractor schedules  
- Avoid setting productive hours equal to total hours (leave buffer for breaks)
