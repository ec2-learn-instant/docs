The **Work Days** settings page allows administrators to configure working days for each employee. This configuration is used to calculate productivity metrics, attendance tracking, and work-hour analytics.

## 📌 Overview

Work day settings define which days an employee is expected to work.  
These settings help Trackpilots:

- Calculate active working hours  
- Filter non-working days from reports  
- Improve productivity and attendance accuracy  
- Support custom schedules for teams and individuals  

> Once your settings are saved, they will be applied and reflected on the dashboard within **1 hour**.

## 👤 Employee Work Day Configuration

Admins can configure work days individually for each employee.

### **Use Cases**

- Full-time employees (Monday–Friday)  
- Shift-based employees (Custom days)  
- Weekend teams (Saturday–Sunday enabled)  
- Remote or hybrid flexible schedules

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Admin selects an employee  
2. Admin enables or disables specific weekdays  
3. Settings are saved  
4. Changes propagate to analytics within **1 hour**

## 📊 Impact on Analytics

Work day settings affect the following modules:

- Productivity dashboards  
- Attendance reports  
- Work-hour calculations  
- Idle vs active time metrics  
- Compliance reports  

> Non-working days are excluded from productivity calculations by default.

## 🔐 Permissions & Access Control

Only users with the following roles can modify work days:

- **Admin**
- **Custom Role with Work Days Permission**

Developers can manage access using **[Page Access Control Roles](/docs/access-control/access-control)**.

## 🧩 Developer Notes

- Work day configurations are stored per user in the **User Settings Service**  
- Changes are cached and synced to analytics pipelines hourly  
- API consumers should respect work day flags when computing metrics  
- Historical data remains unchanged; only future analytics are affected  

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Define standard work days for all employees  
- Customize schedules only when required  
- Align work days with payroll and attendance systems  
- Review configurations monthly for accuracy
