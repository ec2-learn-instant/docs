🔐 **Secure Your API Access**

API keys are used to authenticate and authorize requests to the Trackpilots REST APIs.
</Callout>

## Overview

Trackpilots uses **API Keys** to securely authenticate API requests.  
Each API key is unique and should be kept confidential.

You can generate and manage your API keys from the **Developer Tools** section in the Trackpilots dashboard.

## Create an API Key

Follow the steps below to generate a new API key:

1. Go to **Developer Tools** in your Trackpilots dashboard.
2. Select **API Keys** from the menu.  
   👉 Direct link:  
   `https://app.trackpilots.com/developer-tools/api-keys`
3. Click the **Create API Key** button located at the **top-right corner**.
4. Enter a **name** for your API key.
5. Click **Create**.

🎉 Your API key will be created successfully.

## Important Notes

<Callout type="warning">
⚠️ **Store Your API Key Securely**

The API key will be displayed **only once** at the time of creation.
Make sure to copy and store it in a secure place.
</Callout>

- You **cannot view the full API key again** after creation.
- If the key is lost or compromised, generate a **new API key**.
- Avoid sharing your API key publicly or committing it to source control.

---

## Using the API Key

Use the generated API key as an **authorization token** for all Trackpilots REST API requests.

Example (Authorization Header):

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
